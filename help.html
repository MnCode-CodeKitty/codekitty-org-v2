										<h3><u>Robot Issues</u></h3>
										<details>
											<summary>My Kitty's wheels are loose/wobbly</summary>
											<p>The wheels can be rather tricky to get on just right. Make sure of the following to
												ensure that your Kitty's wheels are solid:
												<ol>
													<li>Remove the hubcap and wheel, exposing the white "servo horn" that seats in the cutout in the wheel.</li>
													<li>Using a small Phillips screwdriver, tighten the small screw in the center of the servo horn so that it is very snug.</li>
													<li>Put the wheel back over the servo horn and turn it, pulling the wheel back so that the horn fits in the cutout in the wheel.</li>
													<li>While pulling the wheel tight against the servo horn, push the hubcap into the wheel so that it seats down inside as far as possible.</li>
													<li>While still pulling the wheel tight, turn the hubcap clockwise so that it is very tight using your fingers.</li>
													<li>Repeat steps 1-5 for the other wheel so that both are firm and straight.</li>
												</ol>
												This process can seem hard at first, but you will find that tightening the wheels really helps your kitty drive more straight and more easily.

											<summary>My Kitty's CircuitPython isn't working correctly</summary>
											<p>If the software on your robot isn't working correctly, or you've modified it and 
												would like to restore it to its original state, you can perform the following steps:
												<ol>
													<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/MnCode-CodeKitty/codekitty/archive/master.zip" target="new">Code Kitty Master Zip</a> from our Github.</li>
													<li>Connect your robot to your computer via USB and navigate to the CIRCUITPY drive.</li>
													<li>Delete all of the files on the CIRCUITPY drive (making sure to back up custom code you want to keep!).</li>
													<li>Copy the entire contents of the Master.zip you downloaded to the CIRCUITPY drive.</li>
												</ol>
												That's it! Now your software is refreshed to the latest version.

											<summary>The infrared sensor isn't working correctly</summary>
											<p>If the infrared object avoidance sensor on your robot isn't working correctly, follow these steps to resolve
												the issue:
												<ol>
													<li>Flip your robot upside-down while your kitty is plugged in to USB and look at the sensor. Are there two lights on it?
														If your sensor is getting power (the far wire is power), there will be a red light constantly lit on the sensor. If not,
														disconnect and reconnect both ends of the left and middle wires, making sure they are firmly connected.
													</li>
													<li>If you wave your hand in front of the two LED bulbs on the sensor, another light should flash on the sensor board.
														If it does not, disconnect and reconnect both ends of the rightmost wire (VCC) on the sensor board and then try again.
													</li>
													<li>If the lights aren't behaving as described above, try swapping the leftmost and rightmost wires connected to the sensor.</li>
													<li>If there's just a solid red light that doesn't change, try adjusting the small gray screw (in the blue housing) on the sensor 
														board. Very small movements can make a big difference!
													</li>
													<li>If none of this resolves the issue, and turning the screw doesn't change the light at all, you could have a bad sensor board.
														You can order a ten pack on Amazon for $10 <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I57HIJ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="new">here</a>.
													</li>
												</ol>
												Hopefully these steps and a bit of trial and error will help you figure out the sensor. If you need more assistance, contact us.
