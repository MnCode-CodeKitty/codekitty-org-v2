										<h4>
											<u>Who We Are</u>
										</h4>
										<p>
											Code Kitty is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt Twin Cities, MN, USA-based non-profit made up of
											experienced engineers and educators who united around a shared vision of a world where 
											<b><i>everyone</i> has the chance to dream and invent and make an impact on the world, 
											and that engineering and technology skills enable that to happen.</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											To that end, we have made it our mission to <b>break down the barriers to equitable 
											technology education and access for all learners</b>. Our research shows that girls 
											and unerrepresented groups self-select out of opportunities to acquire engineering and
											technology skills as early as age 8, so we target elemetary age learners (and their 
											teachers!) before this happens. We know that <i>everyone can be an engineer</i> and 
											experience the joy of being a Maker and being able to bring their ideas to life and 
											effectively solve problems. We have made it our work to provide this opportunity for as 
											many learners as we are able.
										</p>
										<h4><u>What we do</u></h4>
										<p>
											We work to provide equitable access to engineering and technology skills and materials
											by providing a very inexpensive <b>hands-on workshop</b> based around a <b>3D printed robot
											kit</b>. There is a profound sense of "ownership" to be found in building things with our hands, 
											so we provide the robot as a dissassembled kit, and introduce it through a <i>richly integrated
											narrative</i> which puts the learner at the center of a story - their story - of the discovery 
											of the joys of engineering and robotics.
										</p>
										<p>
											The current version of our robot kit is based around <a href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>'s
											amazing <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/overview">Trinket m0</a>
											microcontroller, which runs <a href="">CircuitPython</a>.  This allows us to start out with a purely
											<a href="">browser-based</a> instruction in the <a href="">Python</a> language and seamlessly transition to programming 
											the robot in a now-familiar <a href="">REPL</a>-based environment, using our extremely simplified 
											pre-installed <a href="">library</a> of functions, allowing even very young or inexperienced learners to write simplified
											code that makes their robot light up, change colors, play music, move around, and sense it's inputs and
											environment, creating an immediately gratifying and rewarding experience that shows them <i>they can do it</i>.
										</p>
										<p>
											The best part is that at the end of the workshop, for which we ask a $50 donation per learner, <i>they get to keep
											the robot</i>. We enjoy all of the work and contact and opportunity provided by offering these workshops, but we
											have to admit that the look on their faces when we tell them it's <i>their</i> robot is especially rewarding. We 
											have tried to keep the costs of the robot as low as possible, while providing an experience that is both rewarding
											and fulfilling for learners of all ages and experience levels. 
										</p>
										<p>
											We also offer our workshop at a classroom level, either as a provided addition to an existing curriculum or instruction 
											block, or as an in-house workshop broken up over multiple days of instruction. The robots we provide then stay with 
											the school, allowing them to continue using the robots to provide more learning opportunity even after our workshop is ended.
											We hare happy to support this opportunity for schools, and are available for a host of other education and PTO support 
											engagements on an ad-hoc basis. Please <a href="">contact us</a> if you'd like to work with us to enrich your education offering.
